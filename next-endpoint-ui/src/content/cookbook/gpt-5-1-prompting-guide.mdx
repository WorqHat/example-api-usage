# Introduction

GPT-5.1 is our new flagship model, designed for agentic and coding tasks. It balances intelligence and speed, with a new reasoning mode, improved calibration to prompt difficulty, and enhanced steerability in personality, tone, and output formatting.

This guide focuses on prompt patterns to maximize performance in real deployments, based on internal testing and collaborations. It serves as a starting point for iterative prompting.

## Migrating to GPT-5.1

When migrating from GPT-4 or earlier models, consider the following:

- **Improved instruction following**: GPT-5.1 better understands complex, multi-step instructions
- **Enhanced reasoning**: The new reasoning mode provides more structured thinking
- **Better calibration**: The model adjusts its response complexity based on prompt difficulty

## Agentic steerability

GPT-5.1 offers enhanced control over agent behavior through improved prompt engineering:

- **Personality control**: More consistent personality traits across conversations
- **Tone management**: Better adherence to specified tone and style
- **Output formatting**: Improved structure and formatting control

## Optimizing intelligence and instruction-following

To get the best results from GPT-5.1:

1. **Be explicit**: Clearly state your requirements and constraints
2. **Use examples**: Provide few-shot examples when possible
3. **Structure prompts**: Break complex tasks into clear steps
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on model responses

## Maximizing coding performance from planning to execution

For coding tasks, GPT-5.1 excels at:

- **Planning**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Implementation**: Writing clean, efficient code
- **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing issues
- **Documentation**: Generating clear code comments and docs

## New tool types in GPT-5.1

GPT-5.1 introduces several new tool types:

- **Enhanced function calling**: More reliable function execution
- **Better tool selection**: Improved understanding of when to use which tools
- **Multi-tool coordination**: Better handling of complex multi-tool workflows

## How to metaprompt effectively

Metaprompting involves creating prompts that guide the model to generate better prompts:

1. **Define the task clearly**: Start with a clear problem statement
2. **Specify constraints**: List any limitations or requirements
3. **Provide context**: Include relevant background information
4. **Request structure**: Ask for specific output formats

## What's next

As GPT-5.1 continues to evolve, we'll update this guide with new patterns and best practices. Stay tuned for more advanced techniques and real-world examples.
