# AI-Powered Customer Support Automation Workflow

This workflow replaces manual ticket sorting with an AI-driven triage system. It:

- Extracts ticket details from form submissions
- Uses AI to classify priority + category
- Logs all tickets in your WorqHat database
- Sends an acknowledgement email to the customer
- Automatically routes internal alerts to the right team

A single pipeline now manages the entire support lifecycle with consistency and accuracy.

## Workflow Summary (7 Nodes)

### 1. REST API Trigger

Activated whenever a support form is submitted.

Accepts formdata including:

- email
- username
- message
- attachments (optional)

Feeds raw inputs to the AI node.

### 2. Text Generation (AI Analysis)

**Purpose:** Clean and interpret user-submitted data.

The AI performs three operations:

- Extracts structured fields (username, issue summary, keywords)
- Determines priority (high / medium / low)
- Determines category (bug / billing / default)

Generates:

- personalized acknowledgement mail text
- the "case type" value to drive routing

The output is used by both the database and Switch node.

### 3. Add New Data

Logs each ticket into your collection with the following fields:

- `id` - Auto-generated ticket ID
- `email` - Customer email address
- `query` - Issue summary extracted from the message
- `status` - Ticket status (set to "open")
- `priority` - AI-assigned priority (high / medium / low)
- `username` - Customer username
- `created_at` - Timestamp of ticket creation
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of last update
- `resolved_at` - Resolution timestamp (null initially)

This becomes the single source of truth for all support activity.

### 4. Send Mail (Customer Acknowledgement)

Sends an automated confirmation to the user:

- includes ticket ID
- includes AI-generated personalized message
- assures follow-up based on urgency

Delivered instantly after form submission.

### 5. Switch Case

Reads the category generated by the AI.

Routes the ticket to the appropriate internal team:

- `Bug` → Engineering
- `Billing` → Finance
- `default` → Support Queue

Each branch goes to its own mailer.

### 6. Internal Mail Nodes

Each category (bug, billing, default) sends a targeted internal email containing:

- ticket details
- user info (email, username)
- priority
- query summary
- direct link to the database record

Ensures the right team receives the right ticket instantly.

### 7. Return State

Returns a structured JSON confirming:

- workflow completed
- category assigned
- customer notified
- team notified

Useful for monitoring, dashboards, or chaining additional workflows.

## Outcomes

- Automatic triage for all incoming support tickets
- Consistent prioritization using AI-driven analysis
- Zero manual sorting inside the support inbox
- Faster escalation to engineering and finance
- Improved customer experience with immediate acknowledgement
- Centralized database for reporting and QA

## Recommended Extensions

- Add Slack/Discord notifications for critical priority tickets
- Add HTML → PDF for generating internal ticket reports
- Add Loop Mail for multi-team alerts (e.g., security issues)
- Add If-Else logic to escalate High Priority bugs directly
- Add Text Gen to draft suggested replies for support agents

## Next Steps

Use this pattern to automate any support or operations pipeline:

- onboarding forms
- refund requests
- lead qualification
- escalation workflows
