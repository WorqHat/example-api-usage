# GPT-5 Prompt Migration and Improvement Using the New Features

This guide helps you migrate existing prompts to GPT-5 and take advantage of new capabilities.

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Assess Current Prompts

Review your existing prompts and identify areas for improvement.

### Step 2: Update for GPT-5

Adapt prompts to leverage GPT-5's enhanced capabilities.

### Step 3: Test and Iterate

Test migrated prompts and refine based on results.

## Key Improvements

### Better Instruction Following

GPT-5 better understands complex, multi-step instructions. You can be more explicit in your prompts.

### Enhanced Reasoning

Use the new reasoning mode for tasks that require structured thinking.

### Improved Calibration

GPT-5 automatically adjusts response complexity based on prompt difficulty.

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Review existing prompts
- [ ] Identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Update prompts for GPT-5 syntax
- [ ] Test migrated prompts
- [ ] Measure performance improvements
- [ ] Document changes

## Common Patterns

### Before (GPT-4)

```
Write a function that calculates the sum of an array.
```

### After (GPT-5)

```
Write a TypeScript function that:
1. Takes an array of numbers as input
2. Calculates the sum of all elements
3. Returns the result
4. Handles edge cases (empty array, null values)
5. Includes JSDoc comments
```

## Best Practices

1. Be more explicit about requirements
2. Break complex tasks into steps
3. Specify output format clearly
4. Include examples when helpful
5. Test thoroughly before deployment
