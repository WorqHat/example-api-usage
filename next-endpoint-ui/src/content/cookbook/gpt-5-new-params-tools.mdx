# GPT-5 New Params and Tools

GPT-5 introduces several new parameters and tools that enhance model control and functionality.

## New Parameters

### Temperature

Control the randomness of outputs. Lower values make the model more deterministic.

### Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)

Limit sampling to tokens with cumulative probability up to the specified value.

### Max Tokens

Set the maximum number of tokens in the response.

## New Tools

### Function Calling

Enhanced function calling capabilities allow for more reliable tool usage.

### Structured Outputs

Request structured JSON outputs with schema validation.

### Streaming

Improved streaming support for real-time responses.

## Usage Examples

Here's how to use the new parameters:

\`\`\`javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
  temperature: 0.7,
  top_p: 0.9,
  max_tokens: 500,
});
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

- Use temperature between 0.7 and 0.9 for creative tasks
- Use lower temperature (0.2-0.5) for factual or deterministic outputs
- Set appropriate max_tokens to control response length
- Use top_p for more focused sampling
