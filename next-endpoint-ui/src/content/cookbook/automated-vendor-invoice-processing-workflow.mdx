# Automated Vendor Invoice Processing Workflow

Finance teams routinely lose hours each week manually reading invoice PDFs and typing totals into spreadsheets or ERPs.

This workflow automates that process completely:

- Reads the attached PDF
- Extracts text via OCR
- Uses AI to pull key fields
- Saves the invoice in a structured database
- Alerts the finance team instantly

Once set up, your AP pipeline becomes fully hands-free.

## Previous State

Vendor emails → PDF attached → manual reading → data entry → Slack ping someone → update tracker → repeat.

Issues:

- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- No audit trail
- Slow approvals

## Target State

A deterministic, transparent, automated pipeline:

- Invoices arrive
- OCR reads PDF
- AI extracts Invoice No, Vendor, Amount, Due Date
- Data enters DB with "Pending Approval"
- Finance gets a notification instantly

Consistent, fast, and reliable.

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Email Trigger

**Purpose:** Start whenever a vendor sends an invoice email.

**Captures:**

- Sender
- Subject
- Body
- PDF attachment

This becomes the entry point for invoice processing.

### 2. Text Extraction (OCR)

**Purpose:** Convert the PDF invoice into raw readable text.

**Inputs:** PDF file from the email trigger

**Outputs:** Raw text block containing invoice details

This prepares the data for AI interpretation.

### 3. Text Generation (AI Parsing)

**Purpose:** Convert messy extracted text into clean, structured JSON.

**Extracted fields:**

- `invoiceNumber`
- `vendorName`
- `totalAmount`
- `dueDate`

The AI handles inconsistencies across vendor templates and formats.

### 4. Add New Data (Database Entry)

**Purpose:** Store structured invoice data in the database.

**Sample row added:**

| invoiceNumber | vendorName | totalAmount | dueDate    | status           |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| INV-20391     | Acme Corp  | 1,250.00    | 2025-11-14 | Pending Approval |

This becomes your single source of truth for all invoices.

### 5. Send Discord/Slack Message

**Purpose:** Notify the finance team instantly.

**Message Format:**

```
🧾 New Invoice Received

Vendor: {{vendorName}}
Amount: ${{totalAmount}}
Status: Pending Approval
```

Ensures finance never misses an incoming invoice.

### 6. Return State

**Final output indicating successful processing.**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Invoice processed and stored successfully"
}
```

## Outcomes

- Hours saved weekly on manual AP work
- Clean, structured invoice records
- Instant notifications for approval
- Better compliance and audit trail
- Zero manual data entry

## Recommended Extensions

- Auto-approve invoices below a certain amount
- Add a "Duplicate Invoice" check
- Sync with Tally / Zoho Books / QuickBooks
- Add a reminder workflow ("Invoice due in 3 days")

## Next Steps

Use this pattern to automate any document processing pipeline:

- Purchase order processing
- Receipt extraction and categorization
- Contract parsing and storage
- Expense report automation

Build it once → eliminate manual data entry forever.
