# AI-Powered Email → Calendar Scheduler

This workflow automates one of the most frustrating productivity drains: scheduling meetings.

Instead of manually parsing emails, figuring out dates, and creating calendar events — this workflow does all of it in seconds.

It:

- Understands natural language like "next Tuesday afternoon"
- Extracts meeting details
- Creates the calendar invite
- Emails the person back with a confirmation

All with zero human involvement.

## Previous State

Email arrives → you read it → interpret the date → look up your calendar → create event → send confirmation → repeat for every person.

Outcome:

Slow, repetitive, error-prone, and mentally draining.

## Target State

A fully hands-free automation pipeline:

- Email arrives
- AI reads and extracts meeting details
- Validates intent
- Books the right slot
- Sends confirmation
- You stay focused on deep work

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Email Trigger

**Purpose:** Start the workflow when a new email arrives.

The trigger captures:

- Sender
- Subject
- Body text
- HTML content
- Timestamp

This becomes the core input for the AI.

### 2. Text Generation (AI Meeting Parser)

**Purpose:** Understand whether the email is a meeting request and extract all required details.

**Extracted JSON fields:**

- `is_meeting` (boolean)
- `event_title`
- `start_time` (ISO 8601)
- `duration` (minutes)
- `agenda`

The AI converts vague language ("tomorrow morning", "sometime next Friday") into exact timestamps.

### 3. If-Else Condition

**Logic:**

- `IF is_meeting == true` → continue to booking
- `ELSE` → stop workflow

This prevents the system from scheduling random or spam emails.

### 4. Calendar (Add Event)

**Purpose:** Create the event in your Google Calendar.

**Event includes:**

- Title
- Start time
- End time
- Description (includes original email)
- Attendee (email sender)
- Google Meet link (optional)

This becomes your official meeting invite.

### 5. Send Mail (Confirmation Email)

**To:** The sender

**Subject:** `Confirmed: {{event_title}}`

**Body:** Friendly confirmation with:

- Date & time
- Duration
- Brief agenda

They immediately get the invite + a confirmation.

### 6. Return State

**Final output confirming:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Meeting scheduled successfully."
}
```

If not a meeting request:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "No valid meeting request found."
}
```

## Outcomes

- 100% automated meeting scheduling
- Zero back-and-forth emails
- Reduced cognitive load
- Consistent, error-free invites
- Real-time confirmations sent to sender

This effectively becomes your AI executive assistant, available 24/7.

## Recommended Extensions

- Add conflict detection using Calendar: Fetch Events
- Add reminder emails ("Your meeting starts in 30 minutes")
- Add multi-language meeting replies
- Create a multi-person scheduling flow ("Find a common slot for 3 people")

## Next Steps

Use this pattern to automate any email-based scheduling workflow:

- Interview scheduling
- Client consultation booking
- Team standup coordination
- Automated appointment confirmations

Build it once → never manually schedule again.
