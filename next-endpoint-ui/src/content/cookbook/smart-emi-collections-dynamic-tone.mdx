# Smart EMI Collections with Dynamic Tone

A digital lending team replaced generic payment reminders with a WorqHat workflow that tailors the tone of every EMI message based on days overdue.

Business impact:

- Polite nudges for fresh delays
- Firm reminders for mid-cycle delays
- Legal-tone escalation for chronic defaults
- Higher collection rates with better customer experience

The entire pipeline runs automatically every morning.

## Previous State

Support team manually scanned overdue loans →

Checked how late each payment was →

Copy-pasted different template messages →

Sent WhatsApp reminders individually

Result:

Slow. Inconsistent. Zero personalization. Lower recovery rates.

## Target State

A 7-node automated WorqHat workflow handles the entire collection cycle:

- Calculates delay for each customer
- Classifies tone based on severity
- Generates the correct message tone via AI
- Sends the WhatsApp message instantly
- Runs daily with no agents involved.

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Time Based Runs (Trigger)

**Purpose:** Start the collection routine every day at 10 AM.

**Output:** Initiates the pipeline.

### 2. Query Data (Fetch Overdue Loans)

**Query:**

```
payment_status == "Overdue"
```

**Output:** Array of overdue loans

(loan amount, customer name, phone, due_date, etc.)

### 3. For Loop (Process Each Loan Individually)

Iterates through each overdue record retrieved.

Provides loop context for loan-specific processing.

### 4. Custom Node (Calculate Days Overdue)

**Logic:**

```
days_overdue = Today – due_date
```

**Output:** Integer days late

### 5. Dynamic Tone Logic

Instead of multiple branches, this workflow uses one AI prompt that adapts tone internally based on `days_overdue`.

**Tone categories:**

- 1–7 days: Polite
- 8–30 days: Firm
- 30+ days: Stern / Legal

### 6. Text Generation (Draft Message)

**Prompt:**

```
Write a personalized WhatsApp reminder for {{name}} about the overdue payment of {{amount}}.

Payment is {{days_overdue}} days late.

Tone rules:

- 1–7 days → polite
- 8–30 days → firm
- 30+ days → urgent, mention credit score impact.
```

**Output:** Final WhatsApp message text.

### 7. Send WhatsApp (Deliver Reminder)

**Input:**

- `phoneNumber` → borrower's phone
- `message` → AI-generated content

Sends the message instantly.

### 8. Return State

**Output:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Collection run completed",
  "data": "total overdue accounts processed"
}
```

## Outcomes

- Higher repayment rates through tone-matched messaging
- Zero manual chasing for support teams
- Consistency at scale — new defaults handled instantly
- Improved customer experience with contextual communication
- Automated escalation without rewriting templates

## Recommended Extensions

- Add auto-escalation notifications to internal collections team
- Add payment link generation per message
- Add multi-language AI messaging (English/Hinglish/Regional)
- Add AI categorization of chronic defaulters

## Next Steps

Use this pattern to automate any periodic behavioral messaging:

- Invoice reminders
- Subscription renewals
- Maintenance alerts
- Policy expiries

Simple rule:

If tone needs to change with time — automate it.
