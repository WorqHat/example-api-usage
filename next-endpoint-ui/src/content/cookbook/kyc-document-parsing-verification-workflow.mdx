# KYC Document Parsing & Verification Workflow

A fintech onboarding team replaced their manual KYC process with a WorqHat workflow that reads an uploaded ID card, extracts structured fields, checks for existing customers, and stores new entries automatically.

Result:

- Zero manual data entry
- Instant duplicate detection
- Consistent KYC records across the system

## Previous State

Customer uploads ID →

Agent downloads file →

OCR in a third-party tool →

Manual copy/paste →

CRM update →

Duplicate check (manual) →

Approval

Average processing time: **8–12 minutes per ID.**

Error-prone. Slow. Impossible to scale.

## Target State

A 7-node WorqHat workflow completes KYC parsing in **under 3 seconds.**

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. File Upload Trigger

**Purpose:** Accept ID card images (Aadhaar, PAN, DL).

**Input:** `file`

**Output:** File object for OCR.

### 2. Text Extraction (OCR)

**Purpose:** Convert the uploaded image into raw machine-readable text.

**Input:** `attachments: {{file}}`

**Output:** `content` (raw OCR text)

### 3. Text Generation (Structuring AI)

**Purpose:** Turn raw OCR text into a clean, predictable JSON block.

**Prompt:**

"Extract the Name, ID Number, and DOB from this raw OCR text:

`{{text-extraction.output.content}}`.

Return JSON only."

**Output (JSON):**

```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "idNumber": "...",
  "dob": "..."
}
```

### 4. Query Data (Duplicate Detection)

**Purpose:** Check if the extracted `idNumber` already exists.

**Query:**

```
find customers with ID Number {{structuredData.idNumber}}
```

**Output:** `records[]`

### 5. If-Else Condition

**Condition:**

- `records[] isEmpty` → New Customer
- `else` → Existing Customer

Routes workflow accordingly.

### 6. Add New Data (When New Customer)

**Collection:** `Customers`

**Fields Saved:**

- `name`
- `idNumber`
- `dob`
- `fileUrl` (original uploaded image)

### 7. Return State

#### New Customer Branch

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Verification Successful",
  "data": "{{structuredData}}"
}
```

#### Existing Customer Branch

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "User Exists"
}
```

## Outcomes

- **KYC processing time reduced from 10 mins to under ~3 seconds**
- **Consistent field extraction across ID formats**
- **Eliminated manual entry errors**
- **Automatic DB hygiene via duplicate detection**
- **Instant feedback for onboarding flows & customer portals**

## Recommended Extensions

- Add confidence scoring to flag low-quality OCR scans
- Auto-notify compliance team for mismatched or suspicious IDs
- Attach extracted JSON + file URL to a CRM pipeline
- Add Text-to-Speech for voice-based onboarding flows

## Next Steps

This pattern can power any high-volume verification pipeline:

- Seller onboarding
- Loan document verification
- Insurance KYC
- University admissions
- HR background checks

Build it once → reuse everywhere.
