# Competitor & Market Intelligence Monitor Workflow

Most companies track competitors manually: reading blogs, scrolling social media, checking for new releases, and monitoring product updates.

It's inconsistent, time-consuming, and easy to forget.

This workflow replaces all of that with a weekly intelligence engine:

- Fetches your competitor list
- Searches for relevant updates
- Uses AI to summarize the findings
- Compiles a clean digest
- Sends it automatically

Leadership receives actionable insights without anyone doing manual research.

## Previous State

Occasional Googling →

Outdated competitor docs →

Lost announcements →

No single source of truth →

Zero cadence

Result:

Inconsistent intelligence. Missed competitive moves. No systematic tracking.

## Target State

A predictable, automated intelligence loop:

- Weekly insights delivered on time
- Structured competitor updates
- Single consolidated report
- Zero manual research required

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Time Based Runs

**Purpose:** Schedule the intelligence sweep.

**Example:** Every Monday at 09:00.

This ensures the team gets updates at a predictable cadence.

### 2. Fetch Data (Competitors Table)

**Purpose:** Retrieve your full competitor list.

**Example output:**

```json
[{ "name": "abc" }, { "name": "xyz" }, { "name": "pqr" }]
```

Every competitor moves through the loop.

### 3. For Loop (Iterate Competitors)

**Purpose:** Run research steps per competitor.

Each iteration receives a single competitor's name.

### 4. Web Search (Inside Loop)

**Purpose:** Gather the latest public information.

**Query format:**

```
{{competitor.name}} latest news features releases
```

**Output includes:**

- Headlines
- URLs
- Snippets
- Dates

### 5. Text Generation (Inside Loop)

**Purpose:** Summarize findings into clean intelligence.

**Prompt:**

```
Summarize key updates for {{competitor.name}} using these search results: {{webSearch.summary}}.

Return 3 concise bullet points.
```

The result becomes one competitor's update block.

### 6. Handle Variable (Accumulate Summaries)

**Purpose:** Combine all summaries into one digest.

**Example final output:**

- abc: 3 key updates
- xyz: 3 key updates
- pqr: 3 key updates

### 7. Send Mail (After Loop)

**Purpose:** Deliver the full report to the strategy or leadership team.

**Email subject:**

```
Weekly Market Intelligence Report
```

**HTML body includes the consolidated summaries.**

### 8. Return State

**Purpose:** Provide a clean workflow status output.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Weekly intelligence report delivered",
  "competitorsProcessed": 3
}
```

## Outcomes

- Consistent weekly competitive intelligence
- Zero manual research required
- Search + Summaries fully automated
- Leadership always staying ahead
- Growing historical competitor archive

## Recommended Extensions

- Auto-create a Notion page per week
- Add sentiment scoring for each competitor update
- Highlight "red flag" competitor moves (via AI)
- Create a Slack version of the digest
- Track feature launches and categorize them

## Next Steps

Use this pattern to automate any periodic intelligence gathering:

- Industry news monitoring
- Customer feedback aggregation
- Market trend analysis
- Product launch tracking

Build it once → stay ahead of the competition automatically.
