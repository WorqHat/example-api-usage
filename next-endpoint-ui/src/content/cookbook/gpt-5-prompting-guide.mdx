# GPT-5 Prompting Guide

This guide covers best practices for prompting GPT-5 effectively.

## Understanding GPT-5

GPT-5 represents a significant advancement in language model capabilities, with improved reasoning, instruction following, and output quality.

## Key Prompting Strategies

### 1. Clear Instructions

Always provide clear, unambiguous instructions. The model performs best when it understands exactly what you want.

### 2. Context Matters

Include relevant context to help the model understand the task better. More context often leads to better results.

### 3. Iterative Refinement

Don't expect perfect results on the first try. Iterate and refine your prompts based on the model's responses.

## Common Patterns

- **Zero-shot**: Direct instructions without examples
- **Few-shot**: Include examples in your prompt
- **Chain-of-thought**: Ask the model to think step by step
- **Role-playing**: Assign a specific role to the model

## Best Practices

1. Start simple and add complexity gradually
2. Use specific, concrete language
3. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
4. Provide examples when possible
5. Test and iterate on your prompts
