# Authentication

All WorqHat API requests require authentication using an API key.

## API Keys

Your API key is a secret token that identifies you to the WorqHat API. Keep it secure and never share it publicly.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your WorqHat account
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
}
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments
